# Smart-Water-Meter
The rationing of water is made possible.

Given, each user of this device has his personal RFID, a consumer can be permited to a pre-approved liters of liquid for his/her consumtion. 
The consumer shall be permited to a certain number of scannig through the RFID scanner, each scan gives him/her certain litres of the liquid per day.

Abstract

1. A smart way to conserve water.
2. RF ID Reader, flow meter are installed to taps so that RF receiver limits the usage of water for each tap and flow meter will measure the amount of water.
3. Limiting the usage of water from ground level itself.

Module Identification

1. Flow meter measures the volume of water used ,So that we can easily limit the amount of water.
2. RF ID Reader which gives a limit of water usage for each person.
3. Servo meter which allows/stops the flow of water depending upon the command given by RF receiver to it.
4. The mechanism involved in this is, when RF ID is in contact to receiver , It sends signal to servo motor to open the tap and for each contact there will some limit of water.
5.If the limit of water is flown, automatically servo motor turns off . Also there will be limit for the number of contacts per day. So that we can reduce usage of water as much as possible.
